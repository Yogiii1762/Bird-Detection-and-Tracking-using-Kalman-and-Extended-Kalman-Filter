# Bird Detection and Tracking using Kalman and Extended Kalman Filter

## Overview

This project implements a system for detecting and tracking birds in video sequences using YOLOv4 for object detection and both Kalman Filter (KF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for trajectory prediction. The goal is to accurately detect birds in video frames and predict their future positions, handling both linear and nonlinear motion patterns efficiently.

## Why Use Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)?

The Extended Kalman Filter is used in this project to handle nonlinear motion models that are common in bird flight patterns. While the standard Kalman Filter is efficient for linear systems, bird trajectories often involve complex maneuvers such as sudden turns and changes in speed. The EKF extends the Kalman Filter by linearizing the system around the current estimate, allowing for better handling of nonlinear dynamics. This makes the EKF a suitable choice for tracking birds with unpredictable and nonlinear movements.

## Current Implementation

- **Bird Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv4 to detect birds in each video frame, leveraging a pre-trained model for high accuracy and performance.
- **Kalman Filter (KF):** Implements a standard Kalman Filter for tracking bird trajectories, suitable for linear motion models.
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):** Implements an Extended Kalman Filter to accommodate nonlinear motion, offering improved tracking performance in complex scenarios.

## Future Work Considerations

- **Multi-Object Tracking:** Extend the current implementation to track multiple birds simultaneously, handling object occlusions and re-identifications.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Optimize the code to enhance real-time performance, potentially using GPU acceleration and more efficient algorithms.
- **Advanced Motion Models:** Explore and implement more sophisticated motion models to better capture complex bird behavior, such as maneuvering and flight dynamics.
- **Integration with Other Sensors:** Consider integrating data from additional sensors (e.g., GPS, IMU) to improve tracking accuracy and robustness.
- **Visualization Improvements:** Enhance visualization capabilities to provide clearer insights into tracking performance and trajectory predictions.
